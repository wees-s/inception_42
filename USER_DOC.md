## Services Provided

This project provides a fully functional WordPress website running behind an NGINX web server, with a MariaDB database for reliable data storage.

All traffic is served securely over HTTPS using TLS.

## Starting and Stopping the Project

You can control the project using the provided Makefile.

- **Start the project:**
```bash

```
  or
```bash

```
  This builds the images and starts the containers in the background.

- **Stop the project:**
```bash
  make down
```
  Stops the containers without deleting data.

- **Clean the project:**
```bash
  make clean
```
  Removes containers, images, and volumes.

- **Full clean (including local data):**
```bash
  make fclean
```
  Deletes all Docker data and local persistent files.
